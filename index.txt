    I am currently pursuing my Masters in Applied Computer Science. I have completed my undergraduation in the year 2017 from  India in Information Systems and was always inclined towards web designing which made me come this far to enhance my knowledge and be capable of developing high-end functionalities!

I worked at Accenture for 2 years as a front end developer and backend developer based on the project requirement. Majorly worked on the technologies angular js, jquery, javascript, CSS, Bootstrap and SAP Hybris. So going forward I would like to take up career opportunities which are aligned with my field of interest i.e working as a UX Designer.
